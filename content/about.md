I am currently in the middle of a life long exploration to deeply understand the intersections of  [complex systems](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10699-023-09917-w) and the maximization of their positive impacts on humans. To say this another way, I am of the mindset that in order for humans to build the these large systems, think of the Internet, Healthcare, or even putting humans on Mars. We must be both rooted in practical engineering and a romantic vision of an entity that has the largest net positive impact on our fellow humans. To take this farther, one cannot predict or try to leap forward humanity without accounting for pragmatic deployment of inventions or ideas. I like to call this ideology **Pragmatic futurism**.

This belief originates from over two decades of experience building, researching, and philosophizing the complex systems I interact with, live in, and want to grow.



### Building Large System With Impact 


The most impactful system most people think of to date is the Internet. In my role as a Senior Software engineer at Cloudflare, I help build and maintain many of the core primitives software systems that have become synonymous for the Internet.
Specifically, I work on the [R2](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/) team, which is the object storage platform for all of Cloudflare's products and many impactful companies we as all use.

### Romantic Visionary Pursuits

Recently, I have had the honor to join my  friends'  movie production company.  
There is a currently a movie in post production that I cannot talk about too much now but please keep a look out in the future. 


With that said, I will leave all of you with something I told the crew during night of filming.
