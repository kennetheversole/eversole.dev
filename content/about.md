I am currently in middle of an exploration to deeply understand the intersections of highly complex systems and the maximization of their positive interactions with humans today and in the future. What this means on a high level is many systems humans deeply care about are not judged by being perfect engineering or scientific achievements, but by their net positive  impact on our fellow humans. In simple terms one could say I am on self discovery journey on defining what it means to a **Pragmatic futurist**.

This exploration on a daily basis mirrors the systems I am building and researching...*complex*.  


### Hands on Technical

The largest software project I am currently working is in my role at Cloudflare as Senior Software engineer on the [R2](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/) team, which is Cloudflare's S3 compatible object storage platform. Because the rate of adoption has been meteoric and the team is full of some of the most talented engineers I have worked with in my life, this experience has been the most day over day learning I have ever had. I will hopefully write many blogs about this growth, and the technical learnings  I have had during this experience in the future. If you want to me to talk about any thing specifically please reach out.

#### Past technical experiences
* An original member of the engineering team at [Balto AI](https://www.balto.ai/).
* Consultant at Kicker.AI, and [Utopia Labs](https://utopialabs.com/)
* Boeing





### Helping build human experiences

Recently, I have had the honor to join my  friends'  movie production company.  
There is a currently a movie in post production that I cannot talk about too much now but please keep a look out in the future. 


With that said, I will leave all of you with something I told the crew a during  night of filming.

### General Business

In the last 10,000 years, humans have not invented a more efficient and organizational system  to harness the capabilities of human progress that does not involve economics. Therefore to understand the human interaction part of huge complex systems one must be well versed in  *business*. 

Here is a list of the various business related things I have done and am currently doing: 

* Arch Grants
* Advised the technical direction and implementations for various startups in St. Louis, Missouri.
* Technical due diligence for Venture Capital firms.

### Human Interaction 


To end where I started off, business and highly complex systems are extremely fascinating. It is the human interactions of those systems that sparks curiosity and a sense of transcendence in me.
